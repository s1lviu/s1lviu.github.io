Last night, lack of activity and hitting me with this problem a few days ago I did a little web application that:
  
‚Äì Takes the user‚Äôs location via HTML5 Geolocation
  
‚Äì Generates a link on its
  
How it works and how to use?
  
Link generated is sent (via SMS, Messenger, etc.) to the person who wants to lead you. Person, once access that link and it will automatically open the app Waze point location set your destination.
  
As a utility, I thought that people who use a laptop or desktop and need to send their physical location at the time of Waze for the latter can immediately hit the road in that direction.
  
If you have any suggestions, feel free to share them.
  
Thank you!¬†üôÇ
  
Users who access the site from mobile location services must be activated and of course to allow access to the site ‚Äúlocation‚Äù.
