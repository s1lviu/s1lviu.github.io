Hi, folks!
  
<span style="word-spacing: normal;">It’s been long time since I haven’t posted anything on the blog.<br /> </span><span style="word-spacing: normal;">Today I write a short article about a new open source project I’ve enjoyed short time ago.</span>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">
  WebDollar
</h1>

It’s about <a href="http://webdollar.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WebDollar</a>, a project started by <a href="http://budisteanu.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ionuț Budișteanu</a>, who was a faculty colleague of mine and other passionate <a href="http://webdollar.io/#team" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people</a>.

## The main points of **WebDollar** and what it brings new to the world of cryptocurrencies:

  * it’s easy to use for everyone, a plug-n-play cryptocurrency, without any software downloads or installation
  * start mining right now – as I said, you will have to press a button and start mining in your browser – because Internet coin
  * your wallet it’s accessible in your browser, crypted and secured and NOT saved in any cloud database or something like that – you can view/send and receive webdollars very fast (15 seconds maximum wait time) and create new wallets with one click
  * mine with your mobile/tablet or anything that run JavaScript
  * small size of data downloaded in browser (under 5 MB) then it’s lightest as light
  * <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/ASIC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ASIC</a> resistant – we want to keep people together by offering an referral system and not giving them the big shark impression (those which use specialised mining machines earn a lot and others a little) – everyone will earn as they will invite others to mine in their pools
  * embed and earn – if you have a website and want to monetize it’s content then you will simply embed WebDollar script into your page and earn – without intrusive ads
  * full anonymity  – no cloud database, no software downloads – much better anonymity than bitcoin and ethereum
  * small fees but smaller as transaction value increases – fees inversely proportional to transaction value
