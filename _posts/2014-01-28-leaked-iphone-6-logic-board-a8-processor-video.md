Secretele din spatele placii de baza a noului iPhone 6, dezvaluite:

<div>
  <strong>The next-generation A8 System on a Chip (SoC) is allegedly shown in a new YouTube video uploaded by MrVoolp. This is the third such leak from this user in under a week.</strong>Apparently, someone at Foxconn has access to a lot of iPhone 6 parts, as both the chassis and (now) the logic board have been videotaped and posted online for everyone to glance at.</p> 
  
  <p>
    We can’t confirm the accuracy of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MrVoolp?feature=watch" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MrVoolp</a>’s claims, but the hardware does seem to pertain to an Apple handset, albeit a much larger one than what we’ve become accustomed to.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There are no clear markings on any of the chips shown in the video, but the source says we’re looking at the all-new A8 processor that will power the iPhone 6. Hit the play button and see for yourselves.
